# Network Attacks

## Denial of Service Attack \(DoS\)

Thousands of these attacks happen every year as it is one of the most common attacks out there. It essentially renders any network, host, or infrastructure useless by any user.



Using more than one system to attack one single target is called **Distributed Denial of Service Attack \(DDoS\)**

To implement an efficient **DDoS** you need a lot of computers, a network of compromised computers used by attackers to do damage to others is called a **Botnet.**



The three main types of **DoS Attacks are :**

#### _Vulnerability Attack :_ 

This involves sending a few well-crafted messages to a vulnerable application or operating system running on a targeted host. If the right sequence of packets is sent to a vulnerable application or operating system, the service can stop or, worse, the host can crash.

_**Bandwidth Flooding :**_ 

The amount of packets sent puts strain on the bandwidth essentially clogging it to infinity.

_**Connection Flooding:**_

Floods all of the connection to then make the user think that all of connections are illegitimate. 

## Packet Sniffing 

Everyone uses the internet nowadays, not only that but everyone now is wireless. Packet sniffing is when an attacker uses a packet sniffing tool or codes their own tool to then save a copy of all of the packets sent and received. 

For some Packet Sniffing Tools go [here](../../../ides/network-tools.md).

Packet sniffers are a passive tool so they are not able to send bad packets in a network.
