# Network Attacks

## Denial of Service Attack \(DoS\)

Thousands of these attacks happen every year as it is one of the most common attacks out there. It essentially renders any network, host, or infrastructure useless by any user.

Using more than one system to attack one single target is called

**Distributed Denial of Service Attack \(DDoS\)**

The three main types of **DoS Attacks are :**

#### _Vulnerability Attack :_ 

This involves sending a few well-crafted messages to a vulnerable application or operating system running on a targeted host. If the right sequence of packets is sent to a vulnerable application or operating system, the service can stop or, worse, the host can crash.

_**Bandwidth Flooding :**_ 

The amount of packets sent puts strain on the bandwidth essentially clogging it to infinity.

_**Connection Flooding:**_

Floods all of the connection to then make the user think that all of connections are illegitimate.
