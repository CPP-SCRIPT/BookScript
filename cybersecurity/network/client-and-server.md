## Client and Server

The way that we mostly interact on the internet is through the client server model

A **Client**  is an endpoint and usually asks information to be received from a **Server**

A **Server** is a system in which it can reply to a client's requests via code or response.

**Client Code example is listed** [**here**](https://github.com/CPP-SCRIPT/Examples/blob/master/Networks/WINclient.cpp)\*\*\*\*

**Server Code example is listed** [**here**](https://github.com/CPP-SCRIPT/Examples/blob/master/Networks/WinServer.cpp)\*\*\*\*

For handling big data companies might employ the use of Data Centers or Server Farms to handle all of the Client Request.
