# HTTP

This is the protocol straight from the internet.

This is implemented in two programs, the Client and server.

For implementation on this go to [Socket Programming](../../client-and-server.md).

A Webpage is an instance of HTTP which consists of objects written in HTML, CSS, or Javascript. It also can contain JPEGS, Widgets etc.

Web browser are the _Clients._

Web Servers are the _Servers._

The underlying layer of communication to verify is in TCP and then the main way of communication.

First the HTTP Client initiates a TCP connection, then the client and server process access. 

Once the message is sent it though it is up to the TCP Layer to complete. 

Since the HTTP servers maintains no information about the clients it is a **Stateless protocol.**

HTTP by default uses **Persistent connections** but can be switched to a **non-persistent connection.**
