# HTTP

This is the protocol straight from the internet.

This is implemented in two programs, the Client and server.

For implementation on this go to [Socket Programming](../client-and-server.md).

A Webpage is an instance of HTTP which consists of objects written in HTML, CSS, or Javascript. It also can contain JPEGS, Widgets etc.

Web browser are the _Clients._

Web Servers are the _Servers._

The underlying layer of communication to verify is in TCP and then the main way of communication.

First the HTTP Client initiates a TCP connection, then the client and server process access.
