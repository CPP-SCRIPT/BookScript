This is the protocol straight from the internet.

This is implemented in two programs, the Client and server.

For implementation on this go to [Socket Programming](../client-and-server.md).

A Webpage is an instance of HTTP which consists of objects written in HTML, CSS, or Javascript. It also can contain JPEGS, Widgets etc.
