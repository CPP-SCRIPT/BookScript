# Modulus

## Arithmetic

Modulus in a fundamental in modern cryptography and the public key cryptosystem. Another term for it is to find the remainder of something

For Example 

```text
12/6 = 2; remainder 0
12/5 = 2; remainder 2
```

To find the remainder you use the modulus function

```text
12 (mod 5) = 2
12 % 5 = 2
```
